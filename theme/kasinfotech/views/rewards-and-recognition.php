    <h2><strong>Rewards and Recognition</strong></h2>

    <p><strong>Are you making sure that your employees don't feel unseen or unappreciated?</strong></p>
    <p>
        It is a human tendency to desire <strong>appreciation and recognition</strong> for the work one puts in. We spend a considerable portion of our day at our workspace and thereby, it is important that we feel that our efforts are
        being recognized where it matters the most!
    </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>We believe that a company's lack of <strong>applause and enthusiasm</strong> for its employee's minor and major victories can prove to be detrimental to both the employee and the company.</p>
            <p>When an employee feels invisible at their workplace, it impacts their engagement and involvement with the company.</p>
            <p>Not just that, a lack of rewards can also impact performance and most importantly, the will to contribute to the company's growth.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Shrofile</strong> understands your employee's desire to be recognized and lauded for their work. We also understand the connection between having a carefully thought-out
                <strong>rewards and recognition</strong> program and employee engagement.
            </p>
            <p>This is why we work closely with your company and understand your needs to design a <strong>rewards and recognition program</strong> best suited to you.</p>

    <p><strong>Developed in accordance with your company's needs, to ensure that your employees feel that their work is being recognized and celebrated!</strong></p>

    <div class="row mt-4">

            <p><strong>Shrofile's</strong> carefully curated <strong>rewards and recognition</strong> program is designed keeping in mind the vision and values of your company.</p>
            <p>We realize the importance of recognition and appreciation in the workspace and our <strong>rewards and recognition</strong> program is designed to <strong>empower employees</strong> at all levels.</p>
            <p>Appreciation is a key driver of performance and when employees feel seen, they are motivated to work to the best of their abilities.</p>

            <p>By rewarding your employees, you are also rewarding your company.</p>
            <p><strong>Recognition</strong> of their efforts will encourage your workforce to work towards increased <strong>productivity and growth</strong>, taking your company to new heights.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2><strong>Make sure your top talent feels appreciated and motivated!</strong></h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Work culture</strong> is a crucial consideration for any employee. A workspace that makes its employees feel unseen and unappreciated will exhibit lower employee engagement and a shorter work tenure. This will reflect
        negatively on the company's image and might drive away and the existing employees but also potential <strong>top talent</strong> from your company.
    </p>

    <p>
        By implementing a program that is specifically put in place to praise your employee's efforts, you are taking your company one step closer to making it "a great place to work" and giving your company the chance to get recognized in
        the industry's highly regarded great place to work lists.
